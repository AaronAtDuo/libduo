The OpenSSH build requires application of the patch to the latest
sources, and separately, the attached AuthenticationMethods submethod
patch Markus committed for me upstream (to OpenBSD; Damien hasn't
synced to -portable yet). You can still test using only this patch,
and having Duo be the first and only kbdint method required for login.

The Duo configuration is compiled in, specified at configure time as
detailed in auth2-duo.c:

CFLAGS='-DDUO_APIHOST=\"foohost\" -DDUO_IKEY=\"DI3656...\"' ./configure --with-libduo=../libduo ...

-d.
