The OpenSSH build requires application of the openssh-duo.diff patch
to the latest sources, and separately, the submethod-p.diff
AuthenticationMethods submethod patch for versions of OpenSSH earlier
than 6.2.

An autoreconf is required if applying the patch to a release tarball.

The Duo configuration is compiled in, specified at configure time as
detailed in auth2-duo.c:

CFLAGS='-DDUO_APIHOST=\"foohost\" -DDUO_IKEY=\"DI3656...\" -DDUO_SKEY=\"...\"' ./configure --with-duo=../libduo ...
